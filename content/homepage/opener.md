Single cells use a variety of transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms to regulate the relative abundance of mRNA transcripts of each gene, and at the same time control total mRNA levels by regulating global RNA production and degradtion according to physiological requirements. We are interested in the mechanisms used by cells to regulate gene-specific and global RNA abundance.
