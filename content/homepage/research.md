We are interested in the mechanisms used by cells to regulate gene-specific and global RNA abundance -- ranging from epigenetic memory and cellular decision-making to global RNA metabolism in the context of cellular physiology.

We seek to generate a *quantitative* understanding of these processes, making use of a combination of different imaging modalities, molecular genomics techniques as well as genome and epi-genome editing approaches. Projects are often underpinned by construction of minimal mathematical models at the molecular and cellular level, which we use as a tool for exploring possible explanations of experimental results and prioritising future experiments.

The best science happens in the overlap between fields. We aim to build an diverse team and foster collaborations across fields and disciplines.

#### Stability and plasticity of chromatin-based epigenetic memory

The chromatin of genetic loci can be set into molecular 'states' that control the expression of their underlying genes and also instruct their own inheritance -- acting as an local epigenetic memory elements. When necessary, however, these chromatin can also be switched from one state to another -- by processes that involve coordinated changes to the histone modifications, accessibility of regulatory sequences, and expression states of the underlying genes. We are interested in the interplay between gene-specific diffusible regulatory factors (e.g. transcription factors), which tend to have continuous (analogue) control over gene expression, and heritable chromatin states (e.g. Polycomb-repressed chromatin), which tend to promote bi-modal (digital) stable expression states.

#### Global control of RNA metabolism

Mammalian cells coordinate RNA production with cell size, a process that we discovered relies on adapting transcription rates to nuclear RNA concentratuon

#### Spatial organisation of cells across scales

In recent years, technological advances have made it possible to visualise tens to hundreds of proteins in single cells. This has brought with it the ability to accurately quantify cell-to-cell variability in subcellular organisation. Such quantification captures not only the location and abundance of individual proteins but also their  *relative* abundance in particular subcellular organelles, and the spatial proximity to one another. We are applying these technologies to uncover fundamental principles of how cells organise and reorganise in the context of cellular differentiation and changes to gene expression.
