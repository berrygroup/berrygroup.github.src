#### Scott Berry

###### Group leader

Hi! I am Scott. After completing my undergraduate studies in Theoretical Physics and Biology at the University of Adelaide and the University of Western Australia, I moved to the UK for my PhD at the [John Innes Centre](https://www.jic.ac.uk/). There, I worked with [Caroline Dean](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/caroline-dean/) and [Martin Howard](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/martin-howard/), combining theoretical and experimental biology approaches to understand mechanisms of epigenetic memory in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. I then moved to Switzerland as a [HFSP postdoctoral fellow](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/postdoctoral-fellowships), working with [Lucas Pelkmans](https://pelkmanslab.org/) at the University of Zurich. In Lucas' group, I shifted model systems from plants to mammalian cells, and became immersed in the wonderful world of modern single-cell biology -- focusing on understanding the mechanisms by which cells coordinate gene expression with cell size. Since 2021, I have been a group leader at [Single Molecule Science](https://sms.unsw.edu.au/) at the University of New South Wales, and also joined the [RNA Institute](https://www.rna.unsw.edu.au/) in 2023.

###### Postdoc

I completed my undergraduate degree with majors in neuroscience and pharmacology. My PhD was undertaken at University of Sydney, working with Prof Macdonald Christie, during which I studied the pharmacology of opioid analgesics across in vitro assays and rodent behavioural studies. In the course of that work, I became interested in mathematical modelling of biological systems as a tool to unpick signalling mechanisms. As part of my PhD, I completed a research period at University of Nottingham, working with Prof Meritxell Canals. There, we sought to examine the kinetics of opioid receptor signalling on a population & single molecule level. As a result of this approach to receptor signalling systems, I have become increasingly interested in using similar techniques to systematically deconstruct other biological pathways.

###### Postdoc

Howdy! I obtained my bachelor’s degree in Bioanalysis at Central University of Venezuela and was awarded the Outstanding Undergraduate Project certificate for studying molecular diagnostic techniques of Trypanosoma cruzi. I obtained my master’s degree in Molecular Biology and Biomedicine at University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) in Spain. At a research placement at Prof Banafshé Larijani’s laboratory in the Biophysics Institute (UPV/EHU), we analysed the phosphoinositide and protein physical proximity through the implementation of FRET microscopy to study the biogenesis of nuclear envelope assembly. I completed my Ph.D. candidacy under the guidance of Prof Vytas Bankaitis and Dr. Aby Grabon at Texas A&M University (USA). There, I described the regulatory role of Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate in the dense granule biogenesis and exocytosis in Toxoplasma gondii. I am interested in studying the physiology and biochemistry of eukaryotic cells, including gene expression and inheritance, and how these were shaped through evolution.

###### PhD student

Hello, I am Teddy. After completing my undergraduate in Resource Biotechnology at University of Malaysia, Sarawak, I continued my MSc in Molecular Medicine under Dr Oon Chern Ein at Universiti Sains Malaysia. This project involved collaborative work together with researchers at the Karolinska Institutet, aimed at determining if manic fringe protein expression can be utilized as a biomarker for therapeutics and prognosis in kidney cancer, as well as to determine its association with immune cell infiltration. Our research group also collaborated with the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine to further elucidate the expression pattern of manic fringe in blood vessels of renal cancer and in tumor angiogenesis. I am currently a PhD student researching the global control of mRNA metabolism in human cells.

###### PhD student

Hello, my name is Hongpei. I completed my undergraduate study in Biological Sciences at Jinan University in China, where I developed a strong interest in synthetic biology. I continued to pursue an MSc in synthetic biology and biotechnology at the University of Edinburgh, where I investigated the sugar consumption strategy in budding yeast using quantitative methods under the supervision of Professor Peter Swain. After completing my MSc, I worked as an R&D trainee at Ailurus Biotechnology, developing a bio-computing platform based on understanding artificial biological processes in E.coli using massively parallel reporter assays. I joined Scott's group in 2023 as a PhD student and my current research focuses on understanding quantitative epigenetic memory in human cells using synthetic biology tools.

###### PhD student

Hi! My name is Bailey. I completed my undergraduate degree in Molecular Genetics and Biotechnology at Curtin University in 2021, studying honours under Ryu Takechi at Curtin’s Health Innovation and Research Institute. For my honours project I investigated the effects of Probucol on attenuating neurodegenerative changes associated with APOE4 genotype, using both in-vivo and ex-vivo analyses of transgenic mice expressing human APOE isoforms. I also worked on a murine model of traumatic brain injury where we established early neuropathological developments in the context of repetitive sub-concussion. Since beginning my studies I’ve always held a keen interest in cell biology, and I joined Scott’s group in 2023 as a PhD candidate, focusing on visualisation of transcription and mRNA processing in living cells.
