#### Scott Berry

###### Group leader

Hi! I am Scott. After completing my undergraduate studies in Theoretical Physics and Biology at the University of Adelaide and the University of Western Australia, I moved to the UK for my PhD at the [John Innes Centre](https://www.jic.ac.uk/). There, I worked with [Caroline Dean](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/caroline-dean/) and [Martin Howard](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/martin-howard/), combining theoretical and experimental biology approaches to understand mechanisms of epigenetic memory in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. I then moved to Switzerland as a [HFSP postodctoral fellow](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/postdoctoral-fellowships), working with [Lucas Pelkmans](https://pelkmanslab.org/) at the University of Zurich. In Lucas' group, I shifted model systems from plants to mammalian cells, and became immersed in the wonderful world of modern single-cell biology -- focusing on understanding the mechanisms by which cells coordinate gene expression with cell size. Since October 2021, I have been a group leader at [Single Molecule Science](https://sms.unsw.edu.au/) at the University of New South Wales.
