###### Group leader

Hi! I am Scott. After completing my undergraduate studies in Theoretical Physics and Biology at the University of Adelaide and the University of Western Australia, I moved to the UK for my PhD at the [John Innes Centre](https://www.jic.ac.uk/). There, I worked with [Caroline Dean](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/caroline-dean/) and [Martin Howard](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/martin-howard/), combining theoretical and experimental biology approaches to understand mechanisms of epigenetic memory in *Arabidopsis thaliana*. I then moved to Switzerland as a [HFSP postdoctoral fellow](https://www.hfsp.org/funding/hfsp-funding/postdoctoral-fellowships), working with [Lucas Pelkmans](https://pelkmanslab.org/) at the University of Zurich. In Lucas' group, I shifted model systems from plants to mammalian cells, and became immersed in the wonderful world of modern single-cell biology -- focusing on understanding the mechanisms by which cells coordinate gene expression with cell size. Since October 2021, I have been a group leader at [Single Molecule Science](https://sms.unsw.edu.au/) at the University of New South Wales.

#### Alexander Gillis

###### Postdoc

I completed my undergraduate degree with majors in neuroscience and pharmacology. My PhD was undertaken at University of Sydney, working with Prof Macdonald Christie, during which I studied the pharmacology of opioid analgesics across in vitro assays and rodent behavioural studies. In the course of that work, I became interested in mathematical modelling of biological systems as a tool to unpick signalling mechanisms. As part of my PhD, I completed a research period at University of Nottingham, working with Prof Meritxell Canals. There, we sought to examine the kinetics of opioid receptor signalling on a population & single molecule level. As a result of this approach to receptor signalling systems, I have become increasingly interested in using similar techniques to systematically deconstruct other biological pathways.
